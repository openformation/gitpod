## Contribute

All the built container images are public, so please make sure not to expose anything sensitive within the respective Dockerfiles. If you need a secret within the container, make sure to utilize [Gitpod Variables](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/environment-variables) for that.

Whenever changes are getting merged into the `main` branch, the respective images will be build and pushed to [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/). Afterwards, they are live for all engineers within the company.
